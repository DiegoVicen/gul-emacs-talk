** About this talk

1) Some brief context
2) Getting started with Emacs
3) Don't fear Emacs-Lisp
4) Packages worth checking out
5) Ask me something if I messed up

** The most important Emacs insight

- Emacs has _terrible_ defaults.
- It is super powerful once you configure it.

- Emacs is really old. (that's good)
- There are packages for (almost) everything.

- Is free, like in beer and freedom!

** Wait, that was not the deal!

- "But Diego, I don't want to configure anything, I just want an editor!"

- I have good news for you!
- I can show you the best text editor ever.
- Zero configuration needed.

- "What is it?!"

** ... It's vim!

- Yup. For real.
  - It's everywhere*.
  - It's comfortable.
  - Zero configuration needed.

- You can exit with =:q=, =:quit=, =:wq=, =:q!=, =:exit=, =:x=, =ZZ= and =ZQ=.
  Stop being a baby.

** Where's the trick?

- Probably, you want to do more things apart from editing text.
- Vim is pure UNIX philosophy: it can only edit text^{(but it's super good)}
- Configure, rebind keys, install plugins... You need vimscript.

#+BEGIN_SRC
filetype plugin indent on
  augroup Misc " {{{2
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType netrw call s:scratch_maps()
    " [...]
    autocmd BufWritePre,FileWritePre /etc/* if &ft == "dns" |
          \ exe "normal msHmt" |
          \ exe "gl/^\\s*\\d\\+\\s*;\\s*Serial$/normal ^\<C-A>" |
          \ exe "normal g`tztg`s" |
          \ endif
    autocmd CursorHold,BufWritePost,BufReadPost,BufLeave *
      \ if !$VIMSWAP && isdirectory(expand("<amatch>:h")) |
      let &swapfile = &modified | endif
  augroup END " }}}2
#+END_SRC

** If you want your own editor, welcome to Emacs

- Run this. If the result is larger than 20, install Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :dir ~/
wc -l .vimrc
#+END_SRC

- You will be faster if your tools apply to your whole workflow.
- Starting is slow, it eventually pays off.

- In any case, learn vim. You can thank me later.
