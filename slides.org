** About this talk

1) Some brief context
2) Getting started with Emacs
3) Don't fear Emacs-Lisp
4) Packages worth checking out
5) Ask me something if I messed up

** The most important Emacs insight

- Emacs has _terrible_ defaults.
- It is super powerful once you configure it.

- Emacs is really old. (that's good)
- There are packages for (almost) everything.

- Is free, like in beer and freedom!

** Wait, that was not the deal!

- "But Diego, I don't want to configure anything, I just want an editor!"

- I have good news for you!
- I can show you the best text editor ever.
- Zero configuration needed.

- "What is it?!"

** ... It's vim!

- Yup. For real.
  - It's everywhere*.
  - It's comfortable.
  - Zero configuration needed.

- You can exit with =:q=, =:quit=, =:wq=, =:q!=, =:exit=, =:x=, =ZZ= and =ZQ=.
  Stop being a baby.

** Where's the trick?

- Probably, you want to do more things apart from editing text.
- Vim is pure UNIX philosophy: it can only edit text^{(but it's super good)}
- Configure, rebind keys, install plugins... You need vimscript.

#+BEGIN_SRC
filetype plugin indent on
  augroup Misc " {{{2
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType netrw call s:scratch_maps()
    " [...]
    autocmd BufWritePre,FileWritePre /etc/* if &ft == "dns" |
          \ exe "normal msHmt" |
          \ exe "gl/^\\s*\\d\\+\\s*;\\s*Serial$/normal ^\<C-A>" |
          \ exe "normal g`tztg`s" |
          \ endif
    autocmd CursorHold,BufWritePost,BufReadPost,BufLeave *
      \ if !$VIMSWAP && isdirectory(expand("<amatch>:h")) |
      let &swapfile = &modified | endif
  augroup END " }}}2
#+END_SRC

** If you want your own editor, welcome to Emacs

- Run this. If the result is larger than 20, install Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :dir ~/
wc -l .vimrc
#+END_SRC

- You will be faster if your tools apply to your whole workflow.
- Starting is slow, it eventually pays off.

- In any case, learn vim. You can thank me later.


* Getting started with Emacs

- Install it from your package manager of choice:

| System  | Build                                        |
|---------+----------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu  | =emacs-snapshot= from =ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa= |
| Arch    | =$ pacman -S emacs=                          |
| macOS   | =brew cask install emacs=                    |
| Windows | [[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/][May the gods help you]]                        |

** Booting up!

- Use the GUI version for proper support and eye-candy.
  - Some terminal emulators will capture your modifiers.
  - Don't worry, you'll keep your beloved terminal! -- more later.

- Welcome to Emacs!

** Emacs notation

- =C-f=     :: Press at the same time ctrl and f (ctrl+f)
- =M-d=     :: Press alt+d (probably)
- =C-M-s=   :: Press ctrl+alt+s
- =C-x C-c= :: Press ctrl+x and then press ctrl+c
- =C-x g=   :: Press ctrl+x and then only press g
- =C-c p P= :: Press ctrl+x, then p, and finally shift+p

** First level is always a tutorial

- You can enter the tutorial clicking on the link on the splash screen.
- Another way to enter the tutorial is =C-h t=

- You will learn by practice movement, edition, and basic concepts of Emacs.
- You should do this. Actually, several times.

- When using the editor at first, put effort on practising new skills.

** Muscle memory is the key

- Start using Emacs for small tasks.
- *Learn by conscious practice!*

- Incremental learning usually helps.

- If you don't get used to something, don't worry too much.

** Introducing you to your best friends

- =C-h= prefix is used for help
- =C-h f= :: define a function
- =C-h v= :: define a variable
- =C-h m= :: define the current modes

- =C-h k= :: which function is bind to a keystroke
- =C-h w= :: where a function is bind

- For everything else, =C-h a=.

** Emacs is the self-documenting editor

- Everything is extremely well documented.
- Only your own Emacs can help you understand your own Emacs.
- Third party packages are included in this documentation as well.
- Use them every single time before googling stuff.

** Things I recommend you do:

- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MovingTheCtrlKey][Rebind Caps-lock to Ctrl]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344389/osx-emacs-unbind-just-the-right-alt][Unbind right alt key]]
- [[https://github.com/DiegoVicen/my-emacs#basic-emacs-setup][Take a look at the basic things in my configuration]]

- Use the GUI for full power!
- You can use your terminal inside Emacs.

** Things people recommend but I don't:

- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][Use evil-mode]] to get vim inside Emacs.
- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#toc17][Run Emacs as a daemon.]]
- Install a pre-configured distribution.
- Use =customize=.
